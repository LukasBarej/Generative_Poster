The starting point of the project was to create a distorted portrait and to give any picture an artistic, carved and unfinished look. After some initial tests, I found that the use of Perlin Noise Flow Field produces the most desirable effect.

It was done using Processing. Main code is based on a tutorial by Daniel Shiffman:

After playing around and changing different parameters, I was able to obtain the desired smoky and dreamy effect.

With further manipulation of the code, portraits can be distorted even more and different effects as veins of the stones or seeing a person through a glass can be produced.
